This is a simple arcade game written in JavaScript. It is similar to Missile Command, except you have finer control over your missiles.

Controls:

* Aim with your mouse or trackpad. 
* **Hold** C on your keyboard to boost a missile. 
* Release C to let the missile move under the influence of gravity. 
* Press the Space bar to detonate a missile.
